# crates/pns vs KiCad PNS — parity tracker

Gap #7 in `docs/parity/GAPS.md`: port KiCad's interactive push-and-shove
router (`pcbnew/router/*`) to Rust. This file tracks, per KiCad source
file, what's ported, what's deliberately simplified, and what's not done
yet. Read this before touching a module -- it says why each simplification
exists rather than letting you rediscover it.

## Architectural decisions that apply across the whole crate

1. **`NODE::Branch()` is a full clone, not KiCad's two-tier copy-on-write
   overlay.** Real KiCad branches cheaply off the root (empty
   joints/index, fall through to root on miss) but deep-clones
   joints/index/override-set the moment you branch off a non-root node,
   because every lookup (`FindJoint`, `QueryColliding`, ...) only ever
   consults "this node" or "the root," never a chain of ancestors. That
   machinery exists for interactive, thousands-of-ticks-per-route
   performance on boards with tens of thousands of items. This project's
   boards are small test boards and the frontend drives the backend over
   HTTP per mouse-move (request-granularity, not tick-granularity), so
   `Node::branch` (`src/node.rs`) is simply `self.clone()`. Semantically
   identical for every caller (branch, try an edit, keep or discard);
   asymptotically worse (O(board size) per branch instead of O(delta)).
   If this crate is ever pointed at much larger boards, this is the first
   thing to revisit.
2. **Collision is exact shape-vs-shape (`eda_drc::kimath::Shape::collides`),
   never hull-vs-hull.** This matches real KiCad too: `ITEM::Collide`
   dispatches to the real shapes; `ITEM::Hull()` is a separate construct
   used only by WALKAROUND/OPTIMIZER to shape a path around an obstacle.
   Reusing `eda_drc`'s geometry/constraint-resolution means this router
   and the DRC engine agree on clearance by construction.
3. **No `ARC_T`.** This project's IR represents every track as a
   straight-segment polyline (`eda_model::ir::Track::pts`); nothing ever
   constructs an arc item. Every KiCad pass that branches on "does this
   line contain an arc" takes the non-arc path unconditionally here.
4. **No diff pairs, no meandering/length-tuning, no component dragger,
   no multi-selection drag.** Single track route and single-item
   (segment/via) drag only, matching the task's explicit scope.
5. **Units**: integer micrometers throughout (`eda_model::ir::Um`), like
   the rest of this workspace, not KiCad's internal nanometers.

## Stage 1 -- core (done)

| KiCad file | Port | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `pns_item.h`, `pns_solid.h`, `pns_segment.h`, `pns_via.h`, `pns_linked_item.h`, `pns_link_holder.h` | `src/item.rs` | Done, as a closed `Item` enum (`Solid`/`Segment`/`Via`) instead of a class hierarchy. `HOLE_T`/`DIFF_PAIR_T` not modeled (hole-to-copper clearance is out of scope; see `eda_drc`'s own fidelity notes for that check). |
| `pns_layerset.h` | `src/layer.rs` (`LayerRange`) + `LayerMap` (board layer-name <-> index, not in KiCad -- this project names layers by string, KiCad by a global enum) | Done. |
| `pns_joint.h` | `src/joint.rs` (data) + `Node::next_segment`/`assemble_line` (traversal, since it needs the item table `JOINT` doesn't own in this port) | Done. `JOINT::NextSegment`'s exact rule ported: a `Solid`/`Via` at a joint is *always* a hard stop, even if a same-net segment candidate also exists there. |
| `pns_itemset.h` | Not ported as its own type -- callers just use `Vec<ItemId>`/`Vec<Item>` directly; the filtering helpers (`FilterNet` etc.) weren't needed yet. | Skipped (YAGNI so far). |
| `pns_index.h` | `src/index.rs` -- a uniform grid (not a literal R-tree, same tradeoff `eda_drc::rtree::DrcRTree` already documents), supporting `remove`, which `DrcRTree` doesn't (DRC builds its index once per run; this router mutates constantly). A new small index rather than extending `DrcRTree`, to keep `crates/drc` untouched. | Done. |
| `pns_node.{h,cpp}` | `src/node.rs` | Done, modulo the branching simplification (#1 above) and: no `m_override`/root-fallback machinery (unneeded once branching is a full clone); dangling joints *are* pruned on empty (KiCad leaves them, per its own `// fixme: remove dangling joints`) since pruning is free with a plain `HashMap`; no edge exclusions, no `RULE_RESOLVER` net-tie/keepout hooks (nothing in this project's model to resolve yet); `NearestObstacle`'s true path-length-global nearest search is narrowed to "first leg that collides, nearest hit on that leg" (see `walkaround.rs`/`shove.rs`'s own notes) -- cheaper and almost always the same answer at these board sizes. |
| `pns_utils.cpp` (`OctagonalHull`/`SegmentHull`/`ConvexHull`) | `src/hull.rs` | Done, via a different construction (circumscribing-octagon samples + a shared convex-hull routine) that is always *at least* as generous as KiCad's own chamfer -- see that file's doc comment for the exact argument. |
| `pns_routing_settings.h`, `pns_sizes_settings.h` | `src/settings.rs` | Done. Defaults cross-checked against `pns_routing_settings.cpp`'s real constructor (including the non-obvious default `RM_Walkaround`, not `RM_Shove`). `SizesSettings::for_net` pulls from this project's own `BoardRules` net-class resolution instead of a live KiCad dialog. `free_angle_mode` is permanently off (45-degree-only router, see decision #4-adjacent scope note in the task). |
| `geometry/direction45.h` | `src/direction45.rs` | `CORNER_MODE` narrowed to `Mitered45`/`Mitered90` (no arcs to fillet a rounded corner with -- see decision #3). `BuildInitialTrace`'s "only honor `start_diagonal` when direction is `Undefined`" subtlety preserved. |

## Stage 2 -- LINE_PLACER + WALKAROUND

| KiCad file | Port | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `pns_walkaround.{h,cpp}` | `src/walkaround.rs` | Core `Route()` loop (hug nearest obstacle, re-detect, chain) ported. Simplified: hugs one obstacle item per iteration rather than a whole `TOPOLOGY::AssembleCluster` blob (still converges to the same place over a few more iterations); no `RestrictToCluster` scoping; CW/CCW reported as two plain candidates (`WalkResult::best()` picks the shorter), no live-cursor-proximity fallback (no continuous mouse-tick stream to fall back from in this architecture) or length-expansion telemetry. |
| `pns_line_placer.{h,cpp}`, `pns_mouse_trail_tracer.{h,cpp}` | `src/line_placer.rs` | See that file's own doc comment for the detailed list; headline simplification is posture: this port keeps the explicit direction state and the `/` toggle (`Direction45::right()`) and continues from the last fixed segment's direction, but does not implement `MOUSE_TRAIL_TRACER`'s continuous mouse-trail-area heuristic (automatic posture guessing from how the cursor swept toward the target) -- not meaningful without a continuous mouse-move stream to measure. |

Two real bugs surfaced while getting the stage 2 tests to pass on a
realistic multi-footprint board, both fixed rather than worked around:

- `eda_drc::kimath::Seg::intersect` returned a point along *the wrong
  segment's own direction* for an asymmetric crossing (correct only when
  the two segments happen to be geometrically symmetric, which is why the
  crate's own existing test never caught it -- every consumer inside
  `eda_drc` only ever used `.is_some()`, never the point). Fixed in
  `crates/drc/src/kimath.rs` with a new regression test,
  `asymmetric_crossing_point_is_on_both_segments`; see that function's own
  updated doc comment for the derivation. `walkaround.rs` is the first
  caller in this workspace that actually consumes the returned point.
- [`hull::hull_of`]'s octagon vertices are each rounded to the nearest
  integer micrometer independently, which can shift a vertex up to ~0.7um
  closer to centre than the exact construction -- enough to put a walked
  leg a single micrometer inside the clearance boundary it was supposed to
  stay outside of. Fixed with a small (2um) safety margin baked into the
  circumradius; see `circle_pts`'s doc comment.

## Stage 3 -- SHOVE

`pns_shove.{h,cpp}` -> `src/shove.rs`. See that file's doc comment. Headline
simplifications: no springback stack (always branch fresh -- a batch/
per-request architecture doesn't need cross-call incremental reuse); single
hull-expansion attempt per obstacle, not KiCad's 3-retry-with-growing-
clearance x 4-winding-order search; via push is the direct one-shot
MTV-displacement KiCad itself uses (not `VIA::PushoutForce`'s iterative
search, which KiCad reserves for lead-in/drag, not SHOVE's own via push);
no forward/reverse rank bookkeeping (KiCad's anti-ping-pong mechanism for
"don't shove something back into what already shoved you this run") --
instead the propagation stack has a hard iteration cap and simply fails
(falls back to walkaround) rather than looping, which is the same outcome
KiCad's own iteration-limit path produces.

`shove.rs` operates on its own scratch branch internally (it must -- shoving
genuinely mutates the board) and returns only the diff (`ShoveOutcome`'s
`displaced_lines`/`displaced_vias`); `LinePlacer` stays stateless for
`preview()` the same way it already was for walkaround (every call re-runs
shove fresh from the real world), and only `fix()`/`finish()` absorb an
accepted call's displacement into the session's running
`displaced_tracks()`/`displaced_vias()` for the eventual commit. One real
bug surfaced here too: pushing a via whose centre sits exactly on the
pusher's own centreline (common -- a straight route running directly
through a stitching via) produced a zero-length, direction-less push
vector that never actually moved it; fixed by falling back to a direction
perpendicular to the pusher's own heading in that degenerate case.

## Stage 4 -- API + frontend

`pns_router.{h,cpp}` -> `src/router.rs`. `Router` owns the committed
`Node` and, while a route is in progress, a `LinePlacer` session -- no
persistent working/preview `Node` the way upstream keeps one, since
neither `LinePlacer` nor `shove` need one between calls (see those
modules' own doc comments). Commit granularity is **per finished line**,
not KiCad's per-segment `AddItem`/`RemoveItem`/`UpdateItem`: this
project's own `Track` IR already holds a whole polyline, so a finished
route becomes one `Track` (or two, split at a placed via, plus the `Via`)
instead of one `Cmd` per segment -- a deliberate adaptation to this
project's own data model (see the task's "our JSON is the only source of
truth" rule), not a fidelity gap. A newly added `Cmd::CommitRoute`
(`crates/ops/src/lib.rs`) removes whatever existing tracks/vias a shove
displaced and adds the session's final geometry in one undo step,
generalizing the existing `PasteItems` (pure-add) the same way KiCad's own
`NODE::Commit` generalizes a pure add into "remove the overridden set, add
the branch's own items."

HTTP endpoints: `crates/cli/src/route_api.rs`, wired into `crates/cli/src/
studio.rs`'s existing single-threaded dispatch. One `Mutex<Option<Router>>`
(`route_api::RouteCell`) holds the in-progress session across the whole
gesture -- `start`/`drag_start` build a fresh `Router` from the board as it
stands (same as every other endpoint re-reading `design.json`);
`move`/`fix`/`undo_segment`/`via`/`drag_move` just borrow it back out and
forward into its methods (no re-flattening the board per request, which is
the one thing "keep per-request work small" is actually worried about);
`finish`/`drag_finish`/`cancel` take the session back out, ending it
either way. Preview state never touches `design.json` -- only `finish`/
`drag_finish` do, through `Cmd::CommitRoute`.

Frontend: `web/studio/src/kicad-port/routeTool.ts` (pure, dependency-free
glue -- `DrawState` patch construction, the request-ordering guard and
move throttle every async call needs) + `api/client.ts`'s `route*`
functions + `components/canvas/routing.ts` (the async start/fix/finish/
cancel flows, replacing the old client-only `commitRoute`/
`dropViaAndSwitchLayer`) + `Canvas.tsx`/`useActionRunner.ts` wiring:

| Gesture | Wired as |
|---|---|
| X (start/toggle tool) | `pcbnew.InteractiveRouter.SingleTrack` (pre-existing) |
| click (start) | `Canvas.tsx` pointerdown -> `startInteractiveRoute` |
| click (fix) | `Canvas.tsx` pointerdown -> `fixInteractiveRoute` |
| mouse move (preview) | `Canvas.tsx` pointermove, throttled 50ms + request-guarded -> `routeMove` |
| Enter / double-click / F | `finishDraw`/`pcbnew.InteractiveRouter.AttemptFinish` -> `finishInteractiveRoute` |
| Esc | `common.Interactive.cancel` -> `cancelInteractiveRoute` |
| Backspace | `pcbnew.InteractiveRouter.UndoLastSegment` -> `routeUndoSegment` |
| V (via + layer switch) | `pcbnew.Control.layerToggle` -> `routeToggleVia` (arms the *next* fix, doesn't commit immediately) |
| `/` (posture) | `Canvas.tsx` keydown (no separate upstream `TOOL_ACTION` for this one -- see that handler's own comment) -> `routeMove(..., flipPosture: true)` |
| W / Shift+W (width) | `pcbnew.EditorControl.trackWidthInc`/`trackWidthDec` -> a small fixed preset ladder (this project has no per-board "preferred widths" list the way real pcbnew's dialog does) |

Verified end to end: `cargo test`/`clippy` on the Rust side (including
`tests/real_board.rs`), and `npm run typecheck && npm run test:unit &&
npm run build` on the TS side -- but **not visually**: the task's own
instructions note the in-app browser's tools don't work in this
environment, so the click-through was never watched happen in a live
browser. Treat the frontend wiring as "compiles, typechecks, and the pure
logic it's built from is unit-tested," not as "confirmed to look/feel
right."

## Stage 5 -- DRAGGER

`pns_dragger.{h,cpp}` -> `src/dragger.rs`. Reuses `shove`/`walkaround`
exactly as KiCad's own `DRAGGER` does, rather than reimplementing
displacement; `Router` gained `drag_start`/`drag_preview`/`drag_cancel`/
`drag_finish` (mutually exclusive with a route session) and
`crates/cli/src/route_api.rs`/`studio.rs` gained the matching `POST
/api/route/drag_{start,move,finish}` endpoints (sharing `RouteCell` with
the route session, since a `Router` is only ever doing one or the other).

Scoped down further than `shove`/`walkaround` already are (see
`dragger.rs`'s own doc comment for the full reasoning):
- **Corner drag only** -- grabbing a segment always drags its *nearer*
  endpoint (`Node::item_at`'s shape hit-test finds the segment, then the
  closer of its two assembled-line neighbours is what follows the
  cursor). KiCad's segment-sideways-slide (`DM_SEGMENT`, grabbing a
  segment's middle to slide the whole run sideways) isn't implemented.
- **Free-angle corner relocation**, not KiCad's default 45-degree-
  constrained `dragCorner45`.
- `Mode::Walkaround` while dragging behaves like `Mode::MarkObstacles`
  (reports collisions, doesn't resolve them) -- only `Mode::Shove` keeps a
  drag obstacle-free.

A real bug surfaced and fixed while wiring the via-drag commit path: a via
displaced by a drag's own shove was being removed from the board but never
re-added at its new position (its diameter/drill were only ever carried as
`0, 0` placeholders meant to be re-resolved by `Router::drag_finish`, which
wasn't actually doing that resolution) -- `Router::drag_finish` now looks
up the real via before building its `Cmd::CommitRoute` entry; see
`router.rs`'s `shove_mode_drag_displaces_a_via_and_the_commit_carries_its_real_size`
test, which fails without the fix.

A second real gap surfaced while wiring the frontend's live preview (below):
`DragPreview` never carried the via-drag case's own attached tracks (its
"fanout" -- the ones stretching to follow the via), only the via's own new
point. `Dragger::candidate` always computed that fanout (it needs it for
the mode's own collision check), but `preview()` dropped it on the floor
rather than returning it, so a frontend drawing only `pts` would show the
via jumping across the board with nothing visibly following it until the
drag actually committed. Fixed: `DragPreview` gained a `fanout: Vec<Line>`
field (always empty for a corner drag), covered by
`dragging_a_via_drags_its_connected_track_with_it`'s new assertions. While
in there: `crates/cli/src/route_api.rs`'s `preview_json`/`drag_preview_json`
also never serialized `Preview`/`DragPreview`'s existing `displaced_vias`
field into JSON at all (route AND drag alike) -- a shove-mode preview that
would push a *via* out of the way never showed it moving until commit,
even though the Rust-side data already existed. Both now send
`displaced_vias: [{source_via, x, y}]`; the frontend looks up each one's
real diameter from the board's own still-there via by id rather than this
repeating it over the wire.

**Frontend: done.** `D` (`pcbnew.InteractiveRouter.Drag45Degree`) is wired
into Canvas.tsx's tool system, as its own one-shot action rather than
through the uniform-`(dx,dy)` move/drag system `MovePreview` already
handles for parts/vias/shapes/text (a drag session's shape is an arbitrary
reshape, not a translation -- it needed its own preview state and render
path, the same shape of work the route tool's own frontend wiring was):
see `web/studio/PARITY-pcb.md` section 4 for the click-through. Still not
done, same as upstream's own scope split (`InlineDrag` vs. a plain
footprint `Move`): dragging a *footprint* through the router (so its
attached tracks follow) -- this port's `Dragger` only ever drags a track
segment/corner or a lone via (see the scope list above), matching real
pcbnew's own `CanInlineDrag` rejecting a free-angle footprint drag too
(`DM_FREE_ANGLE`, this port's only mode -- see "Free-angle corner
relocation" above). A plain (non-router) footprint `Move` was already
confirmed, by reading `edit_tool_move_fct.cpp` directly, to **not** drag
attached tracks in real KiCad either -- see `PARITY-pcb.md` section 4's
"Move: connected track ends follow the dragged footprint" row -- so there
is no gap here to close, just a premise the task brief got wrong.

## Stage 6 -- router fidelity gaps (settings dialog, loop removal, highlight-collisions mode)

**"Highlight collisions" mode needed no new backend code at all.** It's
not a distinct concept from what this port already calls
`Mode::MarkObstacles` -- `router_tool.cpp`'s own status-bar summary
literally labels `RM_MarkObstacles` as `"Highlight collisions"`. That mode
was already fully implemented (Stage 1) and already accepted over the
wire (`POST /api/route/start`'s `mode: "mark_obstacles"`); the actual gap
was that **nothing in the frontend ever let a person choose it** --
`startInteractiveRoute` hardcoded `"walkaround"` and `drag_start` never
read a mode from its request body at all. Fixed below, alongside the
settings dialog the task asked for.

**Loop removal (`RemoveLoops`/`FindLinesBetweenJoints`) -- now
implemented.** `RoutingSettings::remove_loops` already existed as a field
(defaulting `true`, matching upstream) but nothing read it; the real
behavior was entirely missing. `Node::find_lines_between_joints` (new,
`src/node.rs`) is `NODE::FindLinesBetweenJoints` narrowed to this port's
one caller: every distinct pre-existing same-net line already in the node
whose two endpoints exactly match a given pair of points.
`LinePlacer::finish` (new `remove_loops` method, called when
`settings.remove_loops` and the route reached a real same-net end -- same
gate as upstream's own `reachesEnd && aEndItem`) checks whether the whole
just-finished connection's two outer endpoints are also joined by some
*other* pre-existing path, and if so marks every one of that path's
source tracks for removal (skipping any with a locked segment, matching
upstream's own rule) via the same `displaced_tracks` map shove already
uses for "remove and don't replace" (an empty `Line` as the sentinel --
`point_count() < 2` already means "no replacement" to
`Router::build_commit`). Deliberately coarser than upstream in one way:
checked once for the whole finished connection (its true start to its
real end), not per internal segment/joint the way upstream's own
per-`JOINT` loop does -- matching this crate's existing "one commit per
whole finished line" adaptation (Stage 4's own doc comment) rather than
upstream's per-segment model. The new route's own runs are never
inserted into `node` while routing at all (module doc comment, same
reason same-net items never need collision exclusion here), so every
match this finds is guaranteed to be a genuinely different, already-
committed line -- never the one just placed. 3 new tests in
`line_placer.rs` (redundant path removed, locked path left alone, the
setting turned off is a no-op). Drag sessions don't get this treatment --
upstream's own `DRAGGER` never calls `removeLoops` either.

**Frontend: `RouterSettingsDialog.tsx` (`Ctrl+<`,
`pcbnew.InteractiveRouter.SettingsDialog`)**, backing `state.routerSettings
= { mode, removeLoops }` -- see `web/studio/PARITY-pcb.md` for the full
field-by-field scope (deliberately narrower than upstream's own dialog:
only `mode` and `removeLoops` have any real effect in this crate, so only
those two are exposed as working controls; Free Angle Mode is shown
disabled with its reason rather than omitted, since the task named it
explicitly). `POST /api/route/start` gained `remove_loops`;
`POST /api/route/drag_start` gained `mode` (previously silently always
`Mode::Walkaround` regardless of what a route session was using -- a
small, real inconsistency this closes in passing). A setting change takes
effect on the *next* `X`/`D` session, not a live one already in progress
-- this app starts a brand new `Router`/session per route or drag (no
persistent one to push a live update into the way upstream's own dialog
does), a deliberate, documented adaptation rather than a gap.

## Known gaps vs. upstream (won't-fix for this task, tracked for later)

- `MERGE_OBTUSE`, `SMART_PADS`, `FANOUT_CLEANUP` optimizer passes (`src/
  optimizer.rs` only ports `MERGE_SEGMENTS`/`MERGE_COLINEAR`, the two every
  plain interactive route and post-shove cleanup actually uses by
  default). `RoutingSettings::smart_pads` exists as a field but, like
  `shove_vias`/`jump_over_obstacles`/`optimizer_effort`/
  `fix_all_segments`/`walkaround_hug_length_threshold`, is never read by
  any routing code in this crate -- struct-shape parity only, not
  implemented behavior (confirmed by grepping for each field's use
  outside `settings.rs` itself: none).
- `KEEP_TOPOLOGY`/`PRESERVE_VERTEX`/`RESTRICT_AREA` optimizer constraints
  (every candidate is still collision-checked, which is the one
  constraint that must never be skipped; the others are refinements).
- Rounded (arc-filleted) corners -- no arc geometry in this port's `Item`
  at all (decision #3).
- `VIA::PushoutForce`'s iterative lead-direction search for via lead-in
  while routing (`buildInitialLine`'s via-placement path uses a simpler
  direct placement -- see `line_placer.rs`).
- `MOUSE_TRAIL_TRACER` (posture guessed from the swept mouse trail) and
  springback (an incremental undo stack so backing the cursor up reverts
  shove/walkaround decisions instead of recomputing from scratch) --
  still not implemented; see `line_placer.rs`'s own module doc comment
  (point 1) and `shove.rs`'s Stage 3 doc comment above for why, and
  `docs/parity/GAPS.md` for this task's own priority ranking of what's
  left in gap #7.
