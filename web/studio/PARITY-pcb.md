# PCB editor parity with KiCad pcbnew

One row per behavior/action. Status is **identical** (same constants/logic,
adapted only where the browser platform genuinely requires it, noted
inline), **partial** (core behavior ported, a real gap remains, noted),
or **missing** (not started).

KiCad source snapshot: commit `8303b2ad` (see the scratchpad `kicad-src`
copy's `COMMIT` file), version 10.99.

Pure-logic ports live in `web/studio/src/kicad-port/*.ts`, unit-tested
with `npm run test:unit` (compiles with `tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` to a
temp dir, runs with `node --test`; see `tools/run-unit-tests.sh`).

## 1. View controls

| Behavior | Status | KiCad file:function |
|---|---|---|
| Wheel zoom about the cursor | identical | `common/view/wx_view_controls.cpp:onWheel` (via `kicad-port/viewControls.ts:handleWheel` + `view.ts:zoomAbout`, which implements `view.cpp:VIEW::SetScale`'s anchor-preserving math) |
| Zoom step size/acceleration (mouse wheel) | identical | `common/view/zoom_controller.cpp` (`CONSTANT_ZOOM_CONTROLLER`/`ACCELERATING_ZOOM_CONTROLLER`, ported in `kicad-port/zoomController.ts`); default is `CONSTANT_ZOOM_CONTROLLER(MAC_SCALE)` on macOS, `CONSTANT_ZOOM_CONTROLLER(MSW_SCALE)` elsewhere, matching source's actual *default settings* (zoom_acceleration=false) -- `ACCELERATING_ZOOM_CONTROLLER` is ported and available but only KiCad's real opt-in path, not the out-of-box default |
| "Center on zoom"/pointer-warp when zooming | missing (by design) | `wx_view_controls.cpp:onWheel`'s `IsCursorWarpingEnabled()`/`CenterOnCursor()` branch -- requires warping the real OS pointer; this app never moves the real pointer (hard rule, and impossible from a web page anyway), so only the non-warping anchor-preserving branch is used, unconditionally. Documented in `kicad-port/viewControls.ts`'s header comment |
| Ctrl+wheel = horizontal pan, Shift/Alt+wheel = vertical pan | identical | `wx_view_controls.cpp:onWheel` (`scroll_modifier_zoom`="none", `scroll_modifier_pan_h`="ctrl" defaults) |
| Native horizontal wheel (trackpad/tilt-wheel) = horizontal pan | identical, with a noted DOM/wx translation | `wx_view_controls.cpp:onWheel`'s `axis == wxMOUSE_WHEEL_HORIZONTAL` branch; DOM has no axis flag, so a dominant `deltaX` is used as the proxy -- see `viewControls.ts:handleWheel`'s comment |
| Middle-drag pan | identical | `wx_view_controls.cpp:onMotion`/`onButton` (`drag_middle` default PAN) |
| Right-drag pan (vs. right-click = context menu) | identical | `wx_view_controls.cpp:onButton` (`drag_right` default PAN); `Canvas.tsx`'s `justPannedRef` distinguishes a real drag from a click so the native `contextmenu` event still fires for a plain right-click |
| Edge auto-pan while dragging | identical, default off | `wx_view_controls.cpp:handleAutoPanning`/`onTimer` (border math, acceleration formula) ported in `kicad-port/viewControls.ts:computeAutoPanDirection`/`computeAutoPanStep`, driven by a `requestAnimationFrame` loop in `Canvas.tsx` (source uses a ~4.17ms one-shot `wxTimer`, documented as `AUTO_PAN_TIMER_MS` but not used as a literal delay). Off by default (`input.auto_pan` defaults `false` in source too) -- toggle in the status bar ("autopan" checkbox, since KiCad's own toggle lives in a Preferences dialog this app doesn't have) |
| Home = Zoom to Fit | identical (board outline stands in for KiCad's "worksheet page") | `common/tool/actions.cpp:zoomFitScreen` (`WXK_HOME` non-Mac, `Cmd+0` on Mac -- `useActionRunner.ts`) |
| Ctrl+Home = Zoom to All Objects | identical (same fit target as Home -- no separate "page" concept in this app) | `actions.cpp:zoomFitObjects` |
| F1 / F2 = Zoom In/Out at Cursor | identical factor and anchor; **not** snapped to a zoom-percent preset list | `common/tool/common_tools.cpp:doZoomInOut` (factor exactly `1.3`/`1/1.3`; anchored at the cursor's current world position). Source then snaps to the nearest entry in a separate `zoom_factors` preset list (`doZoomToPreset`) -- not ported, no such preset list exists in this app yet. Mac hotkey is `Cmd+'+'`/`Cmd+'-'`, not F1/F2 -- a real macOS-only override in source, see "Hotkey extraction" below |
| Zoom In/Out (menu, no default hotkey) | identical | `common_tools.cpp:doZoomInOutCenter` (same `1.3` factor, anchored at the view center instead of the cursor) |
| F4 = Center on Cursor | partial (pan only, no pointer warp) | `common_tools.cpp:ZoomCenter` → `view_controls.cpp:CenterOnCursor` (pans so the cursor's world point becomes the new center; source also warps the real pointer to screen-center, not done here -- same "never move the pointer" rule as above) |
| Ctrl+F5 = Zoom to Selection Area (drag-to-zoom-box tool) | missing | `actions.cpp:zoomTool` |
| F5 / Cmd+R = Refresh | identical (a true no-op) | `common_tools.cpp:ZoomRedraw` (`HardRedraw()`); this app has no GAL render cache to invalidate, so there's nothing to do -- registered as a real no-op rather than left unimplemented |
| Full-window vs. small crosshair cursor | identical | `common.Control.cursorFullCrosshairs`/`cursorSmallCrosshairs`, `state.fullscreenCrosshair` (pre-existing) |
| Grid drawing: dots, with coarsen-when-too-dense | identical algorithm, approximated rendering | `common/gal/graphics_abstraction_layer.h:GAL::GetVisibleGridSize` (the coarsen-by-`gridTick`-until-visible loop, exact thresholds) ported as `kicad-port/grid.ts:computeVisibleGridSize`, used by `painter.ts:drawGrid`. The *coarsening threshold* is exact; the *dot shape* is a simplification of source's two-pass stencil-masked-lines trick (no stencil buffer in Canvas2D) -- see `painter.ts:drawGrid`'s header comment |
| Grid drawing: lines / small-cross styles | missing (no style switcher in the UI) | `opengl_gal.cpp:DrawGrid`'s `GRID_STYLE::LINES`/`SMALL_CROSS` branches; `kicad-port/grid.ts` computes visible spacing for any style, but `painter.ts` only ever renders DOTS (KiCad's own shipped default) |
| Major grid line/dot every 10th line | identical | `graphics_abstraction_layer.h:GAL::SetCoarseGrid(10)` (`kicad-port/grid.ts:DEFAULT_GRID_TICK`/`isMajorGridLine`) |
| N / Shift+N grid cycling, real default grid list | identical | `common/settings/app_settings.cpp:APP_SETTINGS_BASE::DefaultGridSizeList` (the Pcbnew/footprint-editor branch -- 22 entries, mil block then mm block, **not** sorted by size; a literal jump from 1 mil to 5.0 mm is in source and preserved) ported as `kicad-port/grid.ts:DEFAULT_PCB_GRIDS_UM`, used by `Toolbar.tsx`'s grid dropdown and `useActionRunner.ts`'s `gridNext`/`gridPrev` |
| Cmd+U / Ctrl+U units toggle | identical | `common.Control.toggleUnits` (pre-existing; this app folds a third "mil" unit into the metric/imperial toggle, noted in `useActionRunner.ts`) |
| Status bar X/Y (absolute cursor position) | identical | `pcbnew/pcb_base_frame.cpp:UpdateStatusBar` (field 2) |
| Status bar dX/dY/dist relative to a Space-settable origin | identical | `common/base_screen.cpp` (`m_LocalOrigin`, default `(0,0)`) + `common/tool/common_tools.cpp:ResetLocalCoords` (Space) + `pcb_base_frame.cpp:UpdateStatusBar` (field 3). Previously this app's dx/dy was (incorrectly) tied to the move tool's own drag anchor; now a separate `state.localOriginUm`, matching source exactly (the move tool never touches `m_LocalOrigin`) |
| Polar coordinate status bar mode | identical (pre-existing) | `common_tools.cpp:ZoomCenter`-adjacent `SwitchPolarMode`/`DisplayGridMsg` family; `state.polar` |
| Zoom gesture (trackpad pinch) / pan gesture | missing | `wx_view_controls.cpp:onZoomGesture`/`onPanGesture` (wx-specific touch gesture events; not planned -- wheel/trackpad scroll already covers the common case) |
| Click-and-drag zoom (hold middle/right + drag configured to ZOOM instead of PAN) | missing | `wx_view_controls.cpp:onMotion`'s `DRAG_ZOOMING` state (`drag_middle`/`drag_right` = ZOOM is a non-default KiCad setting; this app only implements the default PAN behavior for those buttons) |

### Hotkey extraction fix (foundational, affects every area below too)

`tools/lib/actionsParser.js` mis-parsed every KiCad action whose default
hotkey is wrapped in `#if defined( __WXMAC__ ) ... #else ... #endif`: the
old regex greedily spanned both branches and spliced one platform's
modifier onto the other platform's key. Fixed (`extractPlatformRaw`, with
a regression test in `tools/lib/actionsParser.test.js`) and
`src/kicad/actions.json` regenerated. Corrected entries: `zoomIn`
("Ctrl+F1" → **F1**, mac **Cmd+'+'**), `zoomOut` ("Ctrl+F2" → **F2**, mac
**Cmd+'-'**), `zoomRedraw` ("Ctrl+F5" → **F5**, mac **Cmd+R**),
`zoomFitScreen` ("Ctrl+Home" → **Home**, mac **Cmd+0**),
`common.Interactive.redo` (**Ctrl+Y**, mac **Cmd+Shift+Z** -- was
"Ctrl+Shift+Z" on *every* platform before), `common.Interactive.delete`
(**Del**, mac **Backspace** -- was plain "Del" everywhere, no mac
override at all before). Also fixed: a bare `' '` (space) char hotkey
normalizing to the literal string `" "` instead of `"Space"`
(`common.Control.resetLocalCoords` and two others), which meant Space
could never actually match a real keydown. New `KicadAction.macHotkey`/
`macAltHotkey` fields (`src/kicad/types.ts`) carry a *genuine* macOS-only
override (not just the usual Cmd-for-Ctrl substitution);
`actions/hotkeys.ts:effectiveHotkey()` is the one place every reader
(global hotkey dispatch, menu bar, toolbar tooltips, the hotkeys list
dialog) resolves `hotkey` vs. `macHotkey` the same way. Also fixed in the
same file: `displayHotkey`'s Mac symbol conversion left a stray "+" before
the final key (e.g. "Ctrl+Shift+Z" → "⌘⇧+Z" instead of "⌘⇧Z"), and would
have swallowed a literal "+"/"-" key entirely under a naive fix -- replaced
with an anchored-prefix regex, tested against exactly that case.

## 2. Grid snapping

Not started this session. `components/canvas/gridHelper.ts` still only
does plain grid-round-to-nearest (no anchor snapping to pad centers,
track ends/midpoints, footprint origins; no magnetic pads/tracks; Shift
does not yet disable the grid). Port target:
`common/tool/grid_helper.cpp`, `pcbnew/tools/pcb_grid_helper.cpp`.

## 3. Selection

Not started this session beyond what already existed (see Canvas.tsx's
own header comments). Port target: `pcbnew/tools/pcb_selection_tool.cpp`,
`common/tool/selection_tool.cpp`.

## 4. Edit tool

Not started this session beyond what already existed. Port target:
`pcbnew/tools/edit_tool.cpp`, `edit_tool_move_fct.cpp`. Note: `delete`'s
real per-platform hotkey (Del vs. Backspace) is now correctly extracted
(see above) but `useActionRunner.ts`'s delete handler itself wasn't
otherwise touched this session.

## 5. Context menus and hotkeys

`useActionRunner.ts`'s zoom-action registry was corrected/extended this
session (zoomIn/zoomOut/zoomFitObjects/zoomCenter/zoomRedraw/
resetLocalCoords -- see section 1). The rest of the context-menu/hotkey
surface wasn't otherwise revisited this session.
